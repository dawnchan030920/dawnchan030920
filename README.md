- 👋 Hi, I’m @dawnchan030920. I'm a high school student now so I can only squeeeeze time to have fun coding.
- 👀 I’m interested in C#, UWP, CLI, Software Architecture/Design/Engineer, UI/UX and so on. Pretty sure I haven't lost my passion & curiosity!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SCHOOL STUFF, more specifically VB & verrrry basic algorithms which is too easy and boring. I was able to cope with those stuff 5 years ago...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing. I need to focus on study currently, but I'd like to spare some time on things I like. I love the atmosphere of communities!
- 📫 How to reach me? E-mail can be the best way.

```csharp
Stack<Teck> dawnchan = new Stack<Tech>();
...
System.Console.WriteLine($"Say Hello World!\n{dawnchan.ToString()}");
```
